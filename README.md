# snapchatclone

##Description##

A simplified SnapChat-like application that allows users to tag and send images to other users. After an image is viewed it
is removed from the device and online database, so it cannot be viewed again. This app is based on a tutorial by 
[Nick Walter!](https://stackskills.com/p/how-to-make-a-freaking-iphone-app-ios-10-and-swift-3) and has been upgraded to work
with iOS11 Beta.
